```poetry
-Clock in the middle-

It does not care who moved.
It does not care who stayed.

It just counts.

Every second, one breath
you will never breathe again.

Every minute, your body keeps the count
even if you don’t.

You call it color.
You call it design.

It is time 
And it is leaving you.
```
