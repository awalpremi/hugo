## Work

*Things I’d stand behind in daylight.*

### Professional blog
https://freshprinceofstandarderror.com/  
Long-form writing, systems, sometimes things explained slowly.

### LinkedIn
https://www.linkedin.com/in/apremi/  
The version recruiters expect to find.

### GitHub
https://github.com/awalpremi  
Code, experiments, unfinished code experiments.

### Hugging Face
https://huggingface.co/Awal  
Evidence I did “AI” before it was popular.

## Fun

*Still me, just less.*

https://www.youtube.com/@awalstreetjournal  
Longer takes, voice included.

### Instagram
https://www.instagram.com/awalpremi/
